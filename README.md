# Triple-Triad
The main file to run is triple_triad.py. You should have all other files in the same directory.

There are two phases - the setup phase, and the game phase. The setup phase is used to determine the settings that you would like to play the game with. At any time during the setup phase, type 'help' to receive in-game instructions. These instructions include information on how the game is played and should aid you in your selections.
